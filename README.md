In this path you will learn the basics of JavaScript as well as more advanced topics such as promises, asynchronous programming, proxies and reflection.

What You Will Learn
- Utilize modules for code organization
- Employ classes for code organization
- Understand communication and browser integration
- Demonstrate asynchronous programming techniques
- Use proxies and reflection
